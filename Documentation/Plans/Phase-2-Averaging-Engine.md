# Phase 2: Averaging Engine Implementation

**Status**: 🚧 In Progress  
**Branch**: feature/phase-2-averaging-engine  
**Assignee**: Claudette (Implementation Engineer)  
**Reviewer**: Clive (Review Specialist)

## Objectives

Implement the 30-minute rolling window averaging engine that groups blood pressure readings and calculates averages.

## Scope

1. **AveragingService** - Create service to manage reading groups
   - `createOrUpdateGroupsForReading(Reading reading)` - Auto-group on new reading
   - `recomputeGroupsForProfile(int profileId)` - Full recompute when needed
   - `deleteGroupsForReading(int readingId)` - Clean up on reading deletion

2. **Rolling Window Logic** - Group readings within 30 minutes of first reading
   - If reading within 30 minutes of group start → join group
   - If reading > 30 minutes from group start → create new group
   - Manual session override via `Reading.sessionId`

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Back-dated readings that fall into existing groups
   - Reading updates that change timestamps
   - Reading deletions that affect group membership
   - Timezone/DST handling (readings stored in UTC)

4. **Integration**
   - Wire into `BloodPressureViewModel`
   - Auto-trigger on create/update/delete operations
   - Ensure seamless cooperation with `ReadingService`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AveragingService created with full DartDoc
- [ ] Rolling 30-minute window logic implemented correctly
- [ ] Manual session override supported
- [ ] Back-dated readings recompute groups
- [ ] Reading deletions update/dissolve groups
- [ ] Unit tests achieve ≥85% coverage on AveragingService
- [ ] Zero analyzer warnings
- [ ] All tests passing

## Implementation Notes

### Algorithm Approach
```dart
1. Fetch all readings for profile in relevant time range
2. Sort readings by takenAt ascending
3. Iterate chronologically:
   - If no current group OR reading > 30min from current group start:
     - Save current group (if exists)
     - Start new group with this reading
   - Else:
     - Add reading to current group
4. Save final group
5. Delete any groups no longer referenced
```

### Database Queries
- Use `ReadingService.getReadingsInTimeRange()` for candidates
- Consider window: [reading.takenAt - 30 minutes, reading.takenAt + 30 minutes]

### Manual Session Override
- If reading has `sessionId`, force new group even if within 30 minutes
- Store `sessionId` in `ReadingGroup` for traceability

## Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Single reading creates no group (or group of 1)
- [ ] Two readings within 30 minutes create one group
- [ ] Third reading within window joins existing group
- [ ] Reading outside 30-minute window starts new group
- [ ] Back-dated reading recomputes affected groups
- [ ] Reading deletion dissolves or updates groups
- [ ] Timezone/DST handling (UTC storage)
- [ ] Manual session override forces new group

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Create `lib/services/averaging_service.dart`
- [ ] Implement core averaging logic
- [ ] Create `test/services/averaging_service_test.dart`
- [ ] Integrate with `BloodPressureViewModel`
- [ ] Run full test suite and verify coverage
- [ ] Update handoff documentation for Clive
