## Charts

### Blood Pressure Chart

**Major Issue** Blood Pressure chart shows Systolic and Diastolic on the sane banding

The chart for Blood Pressure is supposed to have an X axis in the middle, and systolic values above the line with diastolic values below the line. Each of the charts (above and below the line) should be coloured per NICE guidelines.

**Minor Issue** the date ticks across the x-axis are too close together to be readable.

**Minor Issue** The Variability (SD/CV) line overflows the X width of the box, causing it to wrap and push the BP data off the bottom of the box.
