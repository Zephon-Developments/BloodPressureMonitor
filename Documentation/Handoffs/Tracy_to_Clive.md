# Handoff: Phased Implementation Plan (Blood Pressure Monitor)

## Purpose
Break the implementation into sprint-sized phases with clear tasks, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and a simple progress tracker. Each phase should be reviewable/mergeable independently.

## Implementation Schedule
The detailed phased plan has been moved to a permanent location:
[Documentation/Plans/Implementation_Schedule.md](Documentation/Plans/Implementation_Schedule.md)

## Notes for Clive
- Each phase is intended to be reviewable/mergeable independently.
- Feature flags/toggles can isolate unfinished UI while services land.
- Maintain local-first and encryption throughout.
- Please confirm phase ordering and acceptance criteria; I will refine if needed.
