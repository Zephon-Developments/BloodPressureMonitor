## Phase 24D – Accessibility Pass Review Refinements

**Date:** 2026-01-03  
**From:** Clive (Review Specialist)  
**To:** Claudette (Implementation)  
**Status:** Review Pending (Blockers Found)

---

## Review Summary

The implementation of Phase 24D is solid in terms of coverage and testing, but there is a critical accessibility regression in the TimeRangeSelector and some minor redundancy issues in other widgets.

## Required Refinements

### 1. Fix TimeRangeSelector (BLOCKER)
- **File:** lib/views/analytics/widgets/time_range_selector.dart
- **Action:** Remove xcludeSemantics: true.
- **Reason:** It hides the interactive segments from screen readers.
- **Recommendation:** Use label: 'Time range selector' and container: true instead of a summary label that includes the current value, as the segments will announce their own state.

### 2. Optimize ProfileSwitcher
- **File:** lib/widgets/profile_switcher.dart
- **Action:** Add xcludeSemantics: true to the Semantics wrapper.
- **Reason:** Prevents redundant announcement of the profile name which is already in the summary label.

### 3. Optimize FABs
- **Files:** 
    - lib/views/weight/weight_history_view.dart
    - lib/views/sleep/sleep_history_view.dart
    - lib/views/medication/medication_list_view.dart
    - lib/views/medication/medication_group_list_view.dart
- **Action:** Add xcludeSemantics: true to the Semantics wrappers around FABs.
- **Reason:** Prevents redundant announcements of the FAB's internal label or tooltip.

### 4. Update Tests
- **File:** 	est/views/analytics/widgets/time_range_selector_test.dart
- **Action:** Add a test case to verify that individual segments are still discoverable by semantics (e.g., using ind.bySemanticsLabel).

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Blocker resolved in TimeRangeSelector
- [ ] Redundancy optimized in ProfileSwitcher and FABs
- [ ] All 1047 tests passing
- [ ] Static analysis clean

Please implement these refinements and hand back to me for final approval.
